# Drone-Controller-with-Computer-Vision-Capabilities-for-the-Tello-EDU-Mini-Drone

## Project Overview
Welcome to the repository for the Drone Controller with Computer Vision Capabilities for the Tello EDU Mini Drone, my senior project for my Undergraduate degree at Governors State University. This project focuses on engineering a Python-based controller for Windows OS, incorporating computer vision capabilities using OpenCV. The system utilizes an SQLite database to store drone and flight data and is designed to be portable on a USB flash drive, requiring no configuration for program launch.

## Course Information
This project was undertaken as part of the Senior Project requirement at Governors State University from December 2022 to May 2023 (Spring 2023 semester).

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- SQLite
- Windows OS
